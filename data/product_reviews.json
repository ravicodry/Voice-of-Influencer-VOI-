    "summary": "SUMMARY:\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a thin addition to the S25 lineup, bridging the gap between the base S25 and the S25 Ultra. It features a 200-megapixel primary camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a 6.7-inch 120 Hz 1440p AMOLED display, 12 GB of RAM, and 256 or 512 GB of storage. The design is sleek and modern, with a floating island camera design. However, the ultra-thin design of 5.8 mm comes with trade-offs, such as a smaller battery capacity of 3,900 mAh and the absence of a telephoto camera.\n\nPOSITIVE KEYWORDS:\n- camera (200-megapixel primary, 12-megapixel ultra-wide)\n- processor (Snapdragon 8 Elite)\n- display (6.7-inch 120 Hz 1440p AMOLED)\n- design (sleek, modern, floating island)\n\nNEGATIVE KEYWORDS:\n- battery (3,900 mAh)\n- trade-offs (smaller battery, absence of telephoto camera)",
